üì∏ Instagram Post Clone (HTML & CSS Practice)
Welcome to the repository for the interface cloning project!

This project is a practical web development exercise focused on replicating the structure, design, and styles of a standard Instagram post, using exclusively HTML5 and CSS3. The main goal is to master the fundamentals of layout and modern visual styling.

‚ú® Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure and content of the post (image, avatar, comments, icons).

CSS3: For the visual design, spacing (padding/margin), the use of Flexbox for alignment, and handling the icons and buttons.

Responsive Design: Special attention has been paid to how the post looks on different screen sizes (simulating mobile and desktop).

üöÄ How to View the Project
You can visualize this project immediately:

Clone the Repository:

Open the File:
Navigate to the main project folder and simply open the index.html file in your favorite browser. No local server is required.

üéØ Learning Objectives
This exercise was designed to reinforce the following concepts:

Flexbox: Efficient use of display: flex to horizontally and vertically align key elements such as the post header and action bar.

Relative Units: Using rem or percentages to ensure the design is adaptable to different screen sizes.

Iconography: Integration and styling of vector icons (simulating 'Like', 'Comment', 'Share' icons) without relying on images or complex frameworks.

Shadow and Border Handling: Applying box-shadow and border-radius to replicate the modern, soft look of the Instagram interface.

ü§ù Contributions
If you have suggestions for improving the CSS, structure, or accessibility, contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.
